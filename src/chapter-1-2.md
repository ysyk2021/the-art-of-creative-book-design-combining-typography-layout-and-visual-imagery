Layout refers to the organization and structuring of content in a visually appealing and readable way. Applying principles of layout design, such as balance, contrast, alignment, proximity, repetition, and white space, can create a cohesive and engaging design that supports the overall message of the book.

Visual Imagery

Visual imagery, such as illustrations, photographs, and graphics, can enhance the overall aesthetic of the book and make the content more accessible and engaging. Choosing the right visual imagery and using it effectively can reinforce the overall message of the book and draw the reader's eye through the text.
